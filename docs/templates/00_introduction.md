# USASpending Code Review System

## Overview

This system provides a comprehensive framework for conducting and documenting code reviews, tracking improvements, and maintaining a history of changes. It implements industry-standard methodologies and complies with key ISO standards:

1. [Kepner-Tregoe Problem Analysis](https://www.kepner-tregoe.com/problem-solving-decision-making/) for systematic problem identification and resolution
2. Six Thinking Hats method by Edward de Bono for comprehensive perspective analysis
3. [DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control)](https://asq.org/quality-resources/dmaic) from Six Sigma for process improvement
4. [PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act)](https://asq.org/quality-resources/pdca-cycle) cycle for continuous improvement

This integration follows guidelines from:
- [ISO/IEC 20246:2017](https://www.iso.org/standard/67531.html) - Software and systems engineering — Work product reviews
- [ISO/IEC 20000-1:2018](https://www.iso.org/standard/70636.html) - IT Service Management System requirements
- [ISO/IEC 27001:2022](https://www.iso.org/standard/27001) - Information Security Management Systems
- [CMMI Development v2.0](https://cmmiinstitute.com/) - Verification and Validation processes
- [IEEE 1028-2008](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/1028/4606/) - Software Reviews and Audits

## USASpending-Specific Components

When reviewing USASpending code, pay special attention to these common components:

- Entity processing pipelines
- Data validation systems
- Configuration management
- API interaction patterns
- Authentication mechanisms
- Reporting subsystems

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Feature Review
A team has implemented a new data processing pipeline and needs a thorough review:

1. Use [`01_review_prompt.md`](#starting-a-new-review) to initiate review
2. AI follows [`02_review_instructions.md`](#conducting-the-review) for analysis
3. Results documented using [`03_review_template.md`](#review-documentation)
4. Changes tracked with [`04_update_instructions.md`](#implementing-changes) and [`05_update_template.md`](#update-documentation)

### Scenario 2: Performance Optimization
Team needs to improve system performance:

1. Use structured prompts to analyze performance bottlenecks
2. Follow Six Thinking Hats to consider all aspects
3. Document findings and recommendations
4. Track improvements with metrics

### Scenario 3: Security Review
Conducting a security-focused code review:

1. Use specialized security prompts
2. Apply risk analysis frameworks
3. Document vulnerabilities
4. Track remediation

### Real-World Example

The following review demonstrates effective use of this template system:

- **Review**: [Runtime Performance Review (March 2025)](docs/reports/runtime_review_20250314_1500.md)
- **Key Findings**: Identified memory leaks in entity processing and inefficient data transformation patterns
- **Implementation**: Refactored critical components with 40% performance improvement

#### Example Documentation

```markdown
## Critical Issues

### [CRIT-01] Memory Leak in EntityProcessor

**Location**: `src/processors/EntityProcessor.cs`

**Analysis**: The processor isn't properly disposing database connections when processing multiple entities in batch mode.

**Impact**: Memory usage increases by approximately 2MB per 1000 entities processed.

**Recommendation**: Implement using pattern with explicit disposal:

```csharp
using (var connection = new DatabaseConnection())
{
    // Process entities
}
```
```
