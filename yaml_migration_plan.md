# YAML Validation Migration Plan

## Overview
Implementing a hybrid approach to move appropriate validations to YAML while keeping core validations in code.

## Migration Tasks

### Phase 1: YAML Configuration Structure [✓]
1. [✓] Define YAML structure for field validations
2. [✓] Create sections for:
   - Field relationships
   - Value constraints
   - Entity mapping configurations
   - Custom validation rules

### Phase 2: Core Code Structure [✓]
1. [✓] Create YAML parser utility (ValidationEngine)
2. [✓] Add validation engine for YAML rules
3. [✓] Implement validation registry system

### Phase 3: Migration of Rules [✓]
1. [✓] Identify and categorize current validations
2. [✓] Move appropriate validations to YAML:
   - Value range constraints
   - Field relationship rules
   - Pattern matching rules
3. [✓] Keep in code:
   - Type conversions with TypeConverter
   - Essential field presence
   - Performance-critical validations

### Phase 4: Testing [IN PROGRESS]
1. [✓] Create test cases for YAML validation engine 
2. [✓] Create test cases for TypeConverter
3. [ ] Verify performance impact
4. [ ] Compare validation results with current system

### Phase 5: Documentation [TODO]
1. [ ] Document YAML schema
2. [ ] Update code documentation
3. [ ] Add validation rule documentation

## Progress Tracking
- Current Phase: Phase 4
- Completed Tasks: 10
- Remaining Tasks: 5

## Notes
- Completed implementation of performance-critical validations in TypeConverter
- Added caching to improve type conversion performance
- All validation rules now properly separated between YAML and code
- Core validations integrated with YAML-based validations in EntityStore
